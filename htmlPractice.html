    <h1>Day 1</h1>
    <hr>

    <p>I've been practicing HTML for a couple days now.<br>
    Over the last couple days I've learned about formatting and changing different elements of the webpage. <br>
    I've decided to make a blog of sorts and track my progress through Github to show my growth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When formating text I can <b>emphasize it</b>, or <i>italicize</i>, or even make a sub or superscript<br>
        such as H<sup>2</sup>O or X<sub>2</sub>.
