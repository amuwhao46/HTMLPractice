    <h1>Day 1</h1>

    <p>I've been practicing HTML for a couple days now.<br>
    Over the last couple days I've learned about formatting and changing different elements of the webpage. <br>
    I've decided to make a blog of sorts and track my progress through Github to show my growth.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When formating text I can <b>emphasize it</b>, or <i>italicize</i>, or even make a sub or superscript<br>
        such as H<sup>2</sup>O or X<sub>2</sub>.
    </p>

    <h1 style="color:green;">Day 2</h1> <!--Made the heading green cause why not-->

    <pre>
        Using the element "pre" preserves the layout of how the text is formatted in the ide.
        Like this, it made a new line without me using the "br" element.
    </pre>

    <p>As mentioned yesterday, there are different styles. They use CSS, although I'm not<br>
    Familiar with that coding language just yet. an example from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3schools</a> 
    <br>shows you can add different colors to text or even the background of the webpage. As can be shown</p>
    <p style="background-color:orange;"> Testing out the background color for the paragraph text<br>
    with multiple lines as well. </p>
    <!--Added a border around the paragraph text-->
    <p style="border: 2px solid DodgerBlue;">Testing the borders as well with HTML</p>
</body>
